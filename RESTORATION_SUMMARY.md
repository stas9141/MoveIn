## ❌ **What's Broken**

### MainActivity.kt - NEEDS FIXING

The MainActivity.kt file needs the following changes:

#### **Issue 1: Missing Parameters in SettingsScreen Calls**

There are **TWO** SettingsScreen calls (lines ~640 and ~805) that need these three parameters added:

```kotlin
onMyApartmentClick = {
    appState.navigateTo(Screen.MyApartment)
},
onCreateAccountClick = {
    appState.navigateTo(Screen.SignUp)
},
onSignInClick = {
    appState.navigateTo(Screen.Login)
},
```

These should be added **BEFORE** the `modifier = Modifier.padding(innerPadding)` line in both SettingsScreen calls.

#### **Issue 2: Missing MyApartment Screen Handler**

Need to add this after the `Screen.ReportConfiguration` handler (around line ~1088):

```kotlin
Screen.MyApartment -> {
    MyApartmentScreen(
        userData = appState.userData,
        onBackClick = {
            appState.navigateTo(Screen.Settings)
        },
        onEditClick = { userData ->
            // Handle edit
        },
        modifier = Modifier.padding(innerPadding)
    )
}
```

#### **Issue 3: Update shouldShowBottomNavigation**

Add `Screen.MyApartment` to the when expression (around line ~65):

```kotlin
private fun shouldShowBottomNavigation(currentScreen: Screen): Boolean {
    return when (currentScreen) {
        Screen.Dashboard,
        Screen.Calendar,
        Screen.DefectList,
        Screen.Settings,
        Screen.MyApartment,  // ADD THIS LINE
        is Screen.TaskDetail,
        is Screen.DefectDetail,
        is Screen.AddEditDefect,
        Screen.ReportConfiguration -> true
        else -> false
    }
}
```

---

## 📝 **Summary**

**Good News:**
- 5 out of 6 files are already correctly updated
- All the UI components and logic are in place
- Only MainActivity.kt needs parameter additions

**What's Needed:**
- Add 3 parameters to 2 SettingsScreen calls
- Add 1 screen handler for MyApartment
- Add 1 line to shouldShowBottomNavigation function

**Estimated Complexity:** LOW - Just parameter additions, no logic changes needed

---

## 🎯 **Next Steps**

1. Manually add the missing parameters to both SettingsScreen calls in MainActivity.kt
2. Add the MyApartment screen handler
3. Update shouldShowBottomNavigation
4. Build and test

All the complex logic (migration, authentication, UI) is already working! 🎉
